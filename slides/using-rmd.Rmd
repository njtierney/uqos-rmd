# What is markdown?

> [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name

# Tradeoffs

.pull-left[

# Pros

* Lightweight, easy to learn (compared to LaTeX / HTML)
* Text looks like output
* Plaintext can be version controlled (git)

# What is rmarkdown?

# How is rmarkdown designed to be used?

.vlarge[
Communicate with decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.
    
An environment in which to _do_ data science, to capture the rich
    narrative around your code as a modern day lab 
    notebook, where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you
    were thinking.
    
For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).

# What does rmarkdown look like in RStudio?

- Running chunks
- Creating chunks
- Running a document
- Markdown syntax
- Cheatsheets for rmarkdown:
  - [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
  - [Rmarkdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

???

- example document is 02-rmd-figures-chunks
  - how to run each chunk
  - how to run the whole document
  - How does the formatting of markdown work?
  - shortcuts for creating chunks

# Your Turn: 
]

.hugew[
Go to `01-rmd-example/01-rmd-example.Rmd`

Do the following tasks:

* Add an introduction heading
* Add your name and date to the YAML header

Describe the data from the airquality dataset using blockquotes (hint: `?airquality`)

Provide:
A bulleted list describing the variables used in the data
A direct quote from the ?data set describing the data
Make a code chunk
Make a library call in the code chunk
Make a plot of ozone and solar radiation

Extra: 

- Make a plot of ozone and temperature

# Demo

---

# What if I want to change the figure?


- Code chunks have options

    `r ''````{r fig.width = ..., fig.height = ...,  echo = ..., }
    ```
    ```

---

# What if I want to keep the images?

```yaml
title:
author:
date:
output:
  html_document:
    keep_md: true
```

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your Turn

## Tasks

Go to `02-rmd-figures-chunks/02-rmd-figures-chunks.Rmd`

Change the fig.width, fig.height, and dev of the figure in plot-1
Add an option to keep the markdown source code (hint: look at the gear icon next to `knit`)
Print the code for one of the figures, but not the other (hint: use `echo = `)


---

# Demonstrate

- There are many other chunk options, to learn about them, I recommend:
  - The RStudio [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)
  - The [official documentation](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/)
  - [R4ds section on rmarkdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html)

# Tables, inline code, Equations

- You can print tables in rmarkdown, and refer to values inside text
- You can also print equations using LaTeX syntax wrapped in `$$`.

???

- Table (kable)
- inline code
- equations

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your Turn

Go to `03-rmd-lm-tables-inline-eqn/03-rmd-lm-tables-inline-eqn.Rmd`

Make a table
Make some inline code chunks
Make an equation describing the linear model used
  
---

# Demonstration

---

# Aside: There are many many options for tables

- `knitr::kable` is simple
- `pander`
- `xtable`
- `kableExtra`
- the list goes on!

# Setting global options 

- What if you have 100 chunks that you want to set the figure for?
- Setting all of these options can be a bit annoying - but there is a better way

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your turn

- Go to `04-rmd-global-opts-device/04-rmd-global-opts-device.Rmd`

- set a global option to: 
  - hide all of the code
  - set the graphics device
  - set the DPI
  
---
  
# Using citations in a document

- bibliographies and citations are super important in 
- You can cite work by putting it in a .bib file in the same directory as your rmarkdown document
- [@Tag] 
- This is then printed at the end of the document, so you normally # References at the end

---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Your turn

- go to `05-rmd-bib-polish/05-rmd-bib-polish.Rmd`
  - refer to the packages that you use and add a citation

# How to troubleshoot an Rmarkdown document

Sometimes you have an error in your rmarkdown document. These can be difficult to track down sometimes, so here is our recommended workflow:

- develop code in chunks and execute the chunks until they work, then move on
- knit the document regularly to check for errors
- if there is an error:
  - recreate the error in an interactive session:
    - restart R
    - run all chunks below
    - find the chunk that did not work, fix until it does
    - run all chunks below
    - explore working directory issues
      - remember that the rmarkdown directory is where the .Rmd file lives

# Your turn

`06-rmd-find-errors/06-rmd-find-errors.Rmd `

# My philosophy on Rmarkdown

- Keep it simple
- focus on content
- Then move it to word or LaTeX if you need to
